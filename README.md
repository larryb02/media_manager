# media_manager
Change of plans, creating this as a website
Will update readme once I start

### TODO
- Create UI
  - Will start with basic ui while working on business logic and polish later on
- Business Logic
  - Authentication
  - Management Tools
    - Blanking out right now, will update later...
  - Web Crawler
    - Will be using wikipedia for my information, b/c I feel like it has the most sources
      - Goal is to be able to lookup all forms of media 
    - May possibly change since wikipedia isn't the most reliable, but I truly only need metadata (release, ongoing, etc..., a brief description would be good as well)
  - Database Setup
    -   Need to setup database interactions as well
    -   As of right now, I'm thinking I need 2 databases
        - One for inventory, one for user credentials + profiles

### Features
- User Auth :: tbd
- List movies, games, tv shows
  - watched, plan to watch, watching
  - played, plan to play, playing
  - etc...
- TBD
### Plans
- Not sure if I'll deploy this to the app store,
  - If I don't have to host any servers, I most likely will deploy
